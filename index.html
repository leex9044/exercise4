<p>A cockapoo is a mix between a cocker spaniel and a poodle. I plan to adopt one in the future for sure!</p>

<p>I've recently been watching a lot of Shiba videos lately because of how intelligent they are. They're known to be very cat like.</p>

<p>I actually own a Labrador at the moment and she is the cutest doggo ever. She's a hunting dog, so my uncle will be taking her for the next weeks to help him out.</p>

<p>I used to have a Shihpoo. His name was Okie and we had him ever since I've moved from California. Unfortunately, he ran away and has never come home :(</p>

<p>I absolutely love Samoyeds. They're so fluffy and smart! But they shed A LOT and require constant grooming.</p>
